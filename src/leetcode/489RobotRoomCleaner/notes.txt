If I am a dumb robot who has only 4 apis and can only move or turn left or right
And I can be at any position in the room?
How do I make sure that I clean the room?


I don't know which position I am in at any time. I can be moving all the time and 
cleaning same cells again and again.

What if I try to move out of the grid? -> You get 0 as your answer to the move.

Can I store positions in my own grid? Relative to my own position?
How do I go about and do that? I think I can't have a fixed structure like a matrix
because in that I don't know which index to start from.

Maybe I need a graph and each cleanable cell is a node? 
Maybe at first I should trace the graph?
Maybe At every point I should start by going 1 pos forward, backward, right and left?
What problem would that solve?

If there are no blocks, we can easily clean row by row or col by col?
In the above way, we don't have to worry about what position our robot is in.

I don't understand what it means by robot is at start facing upwards.
Up means if it is at second row, it would go towards first row.

How do I get to know that the robot has cleaned all cells? -> Maybe I can't know
the answer to this one, like a vaccum cleaner just cleans, you have to turn it off
yourself?

How to not repeat visiting same columns?

room = [
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
],
row = 1,
col = 3

or

room = [
  [0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
],
row = 2,
col = 4
