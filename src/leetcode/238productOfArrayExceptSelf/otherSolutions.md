## Approach 1: Left and Right product lists

```java

class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {

        // The length of the input array
        int length = nums.length;

        // The left and right arrays as described in the algorithm
        int[] L = new int[length];
        int[] R = new int[length];

        // Final answer array to be returned
        int[] answer = new int[length];

        // L[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left
        // Note: for the element at index '0', there are no elements to the left,
        // so L[0] would be 1
        L[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {

            // L[i - 1] already contains the product of elements to the left of 'i - 1'
            // Simply multiplying it with nums[i - 1] would give the product of all
            // elements to the left of index 'i'
            L[i] = nums[i - 1] * L[i - 1];
        }

        // R[i] contains the product of all the elements to the right
        // Note: for the element at index 'length - 1', there are no elements to the right,
        // so the R[length - 1] would be 1
        R[length - 1] = 1;
        for (int i = length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {

            // R[i + 1] already contains the product of elements to the right of 'i + 1'
            // Simply multiplying it with nums[i + 1] would give the product of all
            // elements to the right of index 'i'
            R[i] = nums[i + 1] * R[i + 1];
        }

        // Constructing the answer array
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            // For the first element, R[i] would be product except self
            // For the last element of the array, product except self would be L[i]
            // Else, multiple product of all elements to the left and to the right
            answer[i] = L[i] * R[i];
        }

        return answer;
    }
}

```

## Approach 2: O(1) space approach
Although the above solution is good enough to solve the problem since we are not using division anymore, there's a follow-up component as well which asks us to solve this using constant space. Understandably so, the output array does not count towards the space complexity. This approach is essentially an extension of the approach above. Basically, we will be using the output array as one of L or R and we will be constructing the other one on the fly. Let's look at the algorithm based on this idea.

Algorithm

Initialize the empty answer array where for a given index i, answer[i] would contain the product of all the numbers to the left of i.
We construct the answer array the same way we constructed the L array in the previous approach. These two algorithms are exactly the same except that we are trying to save up on space.
The only change in this approach is that we don't explicitly build the R array from before. Instead, we simply use a variable to keep track of the running product of elements to the right and we keep updating the answer array by doing answer[i] = answer[i] * Ranswer[i]=answer[i]∗R. For a given index i, answer[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left and R would contain product of all the elements to the right. We then update R as R = R * nums[i]R=R∗nums[i]

```java

class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {

        // The length of the input array 
        int length = nums.length;

        // Final answer array to be returned
        int[] answer = new int[length];

        // answer[i] contains the product of all the elements to the left
        // Note: for the element at index '0', there are no elements to the left,
        // so the answer[0] would be 1
        answer[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {

            // answer[i - 1] already contains the product of elements to the left of 'i - 1'
            // Simply multiplying it with nums[i - 1] would give the product of all 
            // elements to the left of index 'i'
            answer[i] = nums[i - 1] * answer[i - 1];
        }

        // R contains the product of all the elements to the right
        // Note: for the element at index 'length - 1', there are no elements to the right,
        // so the R would be 1
        int R = 1;
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {

            // For the index 'i', R would contain the 
            // product of all elements to the right. We update R accordingly
            answer[i] = answer[i] * R;
            R *= nums[i];
        }

        return answer;
    }
}
