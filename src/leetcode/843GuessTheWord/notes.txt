I can guess the word using a word from the word list.
At every guess I get a value representing number of exact matches: value and position

You are given exactly 10 guesses

I take one word and I guess, its output doesn't give me much
I take another word and I guess, this output and the previous output together might give me something


Secret word: acckzz
["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"]
numGuesses = 3

I guess abcczz, I get 4, that means for chars at right places, task is to know
which one is at the right place. We need to eliminate character one by one
Find all characters starting with a? there is none, so a is not possible, find all possible characters with b at second index which is none, so b is also not possible
I guess ccbazz, I get 3
I guess eiowzz, I get 2






words: ["buhuhu", "hahaha", "balleba", "lalala", "churay", "lalaji", "rajpat", "rojiya", "tarzan", "remedy", "bricks", "journa", "kileek"]

notPos = [{b,r},{u,a},{h,j},{u,p},{h,a},{u,t}]
pos = [{l},{a},{l},{a},{l},{a}]
guessResult = [{buhuhu, rajpat}, {lalala, lalaji}, {}, {}, {}, {}]
