```
Distance between centers C1 and C2 is calculated as
 C1C2 = sqrt((x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
There are three condition arises.
1. If C1C2 == R1 + R2
     Circle A and B are touch to each other.
2. If C1C2 > R1 + R2
     Circle A and B are not touch to each other.
3. If C1C2 < R1 + R2
      Circle intersects each other.
