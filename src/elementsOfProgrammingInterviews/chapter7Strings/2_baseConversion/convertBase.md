For converting from base1 to base2:
It is easier to convert the base1 to decimal first
And then decimal to base2

Example: 625 from base 7 to 13

`615 from base 7 to decimal = 6*7^2 + 1*7^1 + 5*7^0 = 306`

```
306 from decimal to base 13 = 
306 % 13 = 7, remainging = 306/13 = 23
23 % 13 = 10 = A, remaining = 23/13 = 1
1 % 13 = 1, remaining = 0
```
Answer is in reverse order = `1A7`
