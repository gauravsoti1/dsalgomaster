# LCM
Lowest Common Multiple

LCM of 15,20?

What is a multiple?
Let's see all multiples of 15:
15 * 1 = 15 
   * 2 = 30
   * 3 = 45
   * 4 = 60

15, 30, 45, 60 all are multiples of 15

Same way multiples of 20 are:
20 * 1 = 20
20 * 2 = 40
20 * 3 = 60
20 * 4 = 80

20, 40, 60, 80 are multiples of 20

Hence, LCM = Lowest Common Multiple of 15 & 20 = `60`

## LCM by Prime Factorization
For LCM of 15, 25 and 30
Prime factorization of 

`15 = 3 * 5`

Prime factorization of 

`25 = 5 * 5`

Prime factorization of 

`30 = 2 * 3 * 5`

```

LCM = 
(Product of Common prime factors of all Numbers) * (Product of remaining prime factors of any two numbers) * (Product of uncommon prime factors of all numbers)

```
Common Prime Factors of 15,25,30 = 5
Common Prime Factors of any two numbers in 15, 25, 30 = 3
Product of uncommon factors in 15,20,30 = 2 * 5

=> LCM = (5) * (3) * (2 * 5) = 150
